      I like good coffee, reading, baking, traveling, and playing classical guitar.
      I am interested in FOSS, security, algorithms, and game theory.

      This website is  a space for me to talk about whatever is rattling around in my head.
      It will likely contain a mix of posts about tech, philosophy, and social issues, as well as
      any projects I am working on.
