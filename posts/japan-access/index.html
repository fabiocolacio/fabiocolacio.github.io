I recently travelled to Tokyo, Japan, and was was amazed by how
accessible it was for the blind and visually impaired! Here I will
share my experiences traveling in Tokyo as a visually impaired person.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Public Transportation
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The train system made the biggest impact to the overal accessibility
in Japan and I was impressed! The trains are fast, effective, and easy to
use, and the rail system had very good coverage of everywhere I needed
to go.</p>
<p>
Using the trains it seems I can go just about anywhere whether it
is a short distance or a long distance away. When navigating the Tokyo
prefecture, there is always a train station in walking distance from
me and the trains come by very frequently. The trains for shorter
distance travel within the Tokyo prefecture arrive every 2 minutes!</p>
<p>
Since the trains depart so frequently, there is minimal planning
required. This makes trips involving transfers to a second or third
train very seamless; you don&#39;t have to worry about waiting long for
a train in another leg of the journey. Longer distance trains arrived
less frequently, but not by much. I can&#39;t recall ever waiting more
than 15 minutes for a train (though I only made two daytrips out of
Tokyo).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> In Southern California where I live, there are many areas
that are completely inaccessible by public transportation. Each city
has a different transportation system with different levels of
reliability. On most routes, the busses arrive once per hour. Because
of the long wait times, you will find trips involving transfers to
other busses will balloon travel time significantly. Travelling to an
adjacent city takes me at least an hour and half: a distance that is
quite small and would take about 15 minutes by car.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="headline-2">
Payment Methods
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
There are a few payment options for the trains in Japan. When you
arrive at the station, you can buy a ticket with cash using the
machines at the entrance. The ticket machines have braille and spoken
content to make them more accessible for the visually impaired. Many
stations also have a service desk where you can buy tickets from an
attendant. You can also get a Suica card which can be loaded with
money to pay for trips.</p>
<p>
I opted to add a digital Suica card into my Apple Wallet. This allowed
me to tap my phone at the turnstyle to enter and exit the stations. I
could load money into my Suica account with other cards in my apple
wallet whenever I wanted to. The fare was automatically calculated and
deducted from my card when I tapped my phone at the turnstyle to exit
the station at my destination. Additionally, I can see my current
balance, the receipts of each train journey I&#39;ve taken, and a map
showing where I entered and exited the train for that journey all from
the Wallet app.</p>
<p>
You can use Suica for most travel. The one exception is with
longer distance travel with reserved seats. In these cases, you need
to buy a &#34;Super (limited) Express Train&#34; ticket to reserve a seat on
the train, in addition to the basic fare which can be payed with
Suica.</p>

<h3 id="headline-3">
Fare Prices
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
In terms of the cost, I found trains to be very affordable. The median
amount I payed per trip in my 10 days in Tokyo was ¥178 which equates
to $1.18 USD at the time of writing. When I traveled to Kamakura (a 40
mile journey, taking about an hour), I payed ¥945, equivalent to $6.24.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The bus fare in my city is a $1.25 flat fee, and costs as
much as $2.50 in some adjacent cities. The fee must be payed again for
every bus you board regardless of distance traveled. If I route a trip
to a nearby city (half the distance as my Kamakura trip), the
trips routed by my phone are 3 hours long. They use between 3 and 6
busses, costing between $5.25 and $8.50 in total. Thats a trip that
takes 3 times as long for half the distance!</p>

Train Station Accessibility
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Train stations are well-designed with many accessibility features
ensure they are easy to navigate for the blind.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-5">
Tenji Blocks
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
In many parts of Tokyo, including every trainstation I&#39;ve been to,
there are tactile yellow <em>Tenji Blocks</em> on the floor. The bright
yellow color makes the blocks easy to see for people with low vision
(and for guide dogs to recognize), and the tactile patterns make them
accessible for us to feel with our canes or under our feet.</p>

<p>
Blocks with truncated domes (dots) are warnings that indicate a change
ahead such as the end of a train platform or a street crossing.</p>
<p>
There are also blocks with straight parallel lines, which indicate a
path you can walk along. I found these lined blocks to be extremely
useful! They allow you to travel with the flow of foot traffic and
feel the tenji blocks underfoot to know when a path could branch into
multiple areas. I was impressed by the
usefulness of these blocks. Without these, a white cane user with more severe
vision loss would have to stay close to the walls and feel for
openings or branching paths in addition to using auditory information
to orient themselves. This method can be challening in areas that are
very large with many connecting areas, especially if there has a lot
of foot traffic (like a train station!).</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-6">
Auditory Cues
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
In the train station, there are many sounds going on all the time that
the average traveller might dismiss or ignore, but these signals
convey important information to help the blind navigate.</p>
<p>
When you enter or exit the train station, a &#34;ding-dong&#34; sound
indicates the location of the ticket gates.</p>
<p>
Many stations also have a bird chirping sound which indicates the
location of the stairs to the train platform.</p>
<p>
At the train platform there are announcements about the trains
arriving in Japanese and English so you can know if it is the correct
train.</p>
<p>
There is also the Hassha Merodi: the train departure melody. This is a
melody that plays when the train arrives at the platform and opens the
doors. The melody indicates that people can enter or exit the train,
and a few seconds after the melody stops, the doors will close. A fun
part of the Hassha Merodi is that most stations have a unique melody
so you can hear a different one at each location. The <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/the-man-behind-japans-train-departure-melodies">composer</a> (former
keyboardist for Caseopia) wrote over 170 of these melodies!</p>
<p>
While on the trains themselves, the train says the name of each stop
out loud in Japanese and in English as well as displaying it on a
screen overhead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-7">
Braille
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Braille is very common in Japan. Ticket machines, train seat numbers,
vending machines, signs and maps, and even buttons on their toilets
all have braille on them.  There  was even braille on the handrails for
the stairs at the train platform. The braille on these handrails
indicate information about the platform you are entering, conveying
the same information that is on an overhead sign above the stairs.</p>

Overall Accessibility in Japan
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
While the trains provide a higher degree of mobility to me than I&#39;ve
experienced anywhere, the accessibility features do not end there.</p>
<p>
The same well thought out designs that are applied to the train
stations are also found everywhere when out and about in the
city. Braille and auditory cues are very common. Tenji blocks are used
throughout the cities. Many elevators are talking elevators which
announce the current floor to the user when the door opens. In busy
urban areas, the signal to cross the street has Accessible Pedestrian
Signals (APS systems) which play a noise to denote when to cross the
streets. Many of these APS systems also include a button that makes
the duration of the cross signal longer.</p>
<p>
With all this said, Tokyo is without a doubt the most blind accessible
place I&#39;ve ever visited!</p>
